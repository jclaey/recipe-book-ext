This is an extended version of a previous project. The original project was very simple. It enabled users to sign up and then create and store recipes.

This new version will allow users to share their recipes with all of the other users, if they so choose to do so.

It will also allow users to sign up via Google, using Google Oauth.

There will be additional functionality as well, that I have not fully decided upon yet.
